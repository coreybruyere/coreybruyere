# Hello world ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my Github webpage! 

This page once hosted v2 of personal website (which was built with Roots and Wordpress and can now be found over at [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/coreybruyere/coreybruyere)). The newest version (v3 â€” temporary, while I work on v4) of my personal website can be found [here](https://github.com/coreybruyere/coreybruyere-v3). 

This web page <sup>(repo)</sup> has been repurposed to share my thoughts along with images from the world wide web that I find interesting. Thanks for visiting!
